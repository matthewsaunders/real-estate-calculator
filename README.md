# real-estate-calculator

This project is a basic calculator used to project cash to close, estimate monthly costs, and a few other metrics in between for purchasing a condo. It uses a link from Redfin to collect information on the condo and start the cost simulation.  From there, the user can change the inputs and "turn the knobs" of the simulation.

More documentation to come.
